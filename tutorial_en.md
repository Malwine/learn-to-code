## Step 1: Set up your project

At first create a new folder in the console and name it as you like e.g. "namegenerator":

    mkdir namegenerator

Then we navigate into this folder:

    cd namegenerator

In this folder we will create 3 files for a start:
  - Gemfile
  - index.erb
  - name_generator.rb

We will set these files up and input a few lines in every file. We'll check with every file if it works. Once we are done we will continue coding and dive deeper.

### The Gemfile

The first file we create is the Gemfile. You can imagine it as a toolbox where we can specify which additional software we want to use. In our case we want to use the web application framework Sinatra.

Create a Gemfile in the console:

    touch Gemfile

After that open the Gemfile in your editor and input the following lines:
``` ruby
# Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem 'sinatra'
```
Now head back to your console and run

    bundle

in your folder. It will show you a few lines including `Bundle complete!`. If you see that: Perfect, you're done!

### The frontend file

The second file we create is our frontend file. Almost all the code we input in this file will be visible in the Browser.

Have a look at the following lines. Talk about what you think these lines will do.
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The Best Name Generator</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Unicorn Name Generator</h1>
    <p>Your name is:</p>
    <strong>Fluffy Giggle</strong>
  </body>
</html>
```

Once you talked about it head over into the console and create a new folder:

    mkdir views

Create a new file called index.erb in the views folder like the following:

    touch views/index.erb

Open the file in your editor. Then input the code lines above. We will check in a bit if our assumptions were correct.

*Hint: the file ending .ERB stands for embedded Ruby, this means that we can write HTML code which includes ruby code in it. If you want to create a normal website without Ruby then you would use the ending .html like so: index.html We will learn more about how we can embed Ruby in Step 2.*

### The backend file

The backend file contains Ruby code which is our logic part of the app. It will make our app 'react' to our input.

Create the backend file in the console with 

    touch name_generator.rb

and open it in your editor.
Input the following lines of code:
``` ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  erb :index, :locals => { :name => "Awesome Orange" }
end

```

In the console type 

    ruby name_generator.rb

With this command we are starting our app on our computer. To see the app running we go to our browser and type in the url bar: [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567/).

## Step 2: Making our app dynamic
At the moment our app is still static. This means that our name generator doesn't generate a name. Everytime we reload we get the name "Fluffy Giggle". But we want it to be a random name. What can we do?

You might have seen that in the backend file the name "Awesome Orange" is specified. Let's start by handing this name over to the front end.

Go to the frontend file and instead of 
    
    <strong>Fluffy Giggle</strong>

input the following line:

    <strong><%= name %></strong>

Reload the app in the browser. What changes do you see? Take a few minutes to discuss and ask questions.

We exchanged the words "Fluffy Giggle" by Ruby code. All code bewteen these signs `<%= %>` will be Ruby code.
In our case that is a variable calles `name`. From the backend we send data that is saved in the `name` variable and then the frontend shows us what data we have stored in `name`. We specified in the backend that it is "Awesome Orange".

---

ðŸ¤” "Ok, but that is not random!" you might say now...
Well, let's make a first little randomizer. Read the following lines of code. What are your ideas what they do?

``` ruby
def choose_random_name
  ["Exciting Eraser", "Sunny Beans", "Rainbow Glitter"].sample
end

get '/' do
  erb :index, :locals => { :name => choose_random_name }
end
```
Once you discussed the code head over to the backend file in your editor.
Add the code above. The code you see in the first 3 lines is called "method".

The code below starting with `get '/' do` is always executed when we reload our app in the browser.
Instead of "Awesome Orange" we want to "call" our method `choose_random_name` and it will give us a random name every time we reload the browser.

Great! We get a random name on reload! PARTY! :tada:

## Step 3: How the internet works

The Internet is a big network including many routers and computers, either clients or servers.
Client computers are mostly our personal computers or work computers. Servers are also normal computers but they are available 24 hours and most of them are accessible to many people.

![Clients and Servers make the internet](/pictures/internet.png)

When we want to see a website, e.g. `http://railsgirlsberlin.de/` then we do a GET **request** to the server that stores the files for the website. The server responds with the content and sends it back to us. This is called a **response**. Then our browser interprets the files and renders the website.

![request](/pictures/request.png)
![request](/pictures/response.png)

#### Requests

There are different types of requests. Today we will also learn about the GET and the POST request.

**GET Request**

In Sinatra, the web app framework we use, we defined what happens when somebody sends us a GET request by these lines:
``` ruby
get '/' do
  erb :index, :locals => { :name => choose_random_name }
end
```
Do you see the word "get" that starts the code block? Once our app receives a GET request all the code between `do` and `end` is executed. So what happens? The index.erb file is send back to the client and also a randomly chosen name.

**POST Request**

The POST request enables us to send some data to the server, e.g. our name from an input field or our favorite color selected from a dropdown.

So before we define our POST request we create an input field in our frontend file. Below our `<h1>` headline element we can input the following code:

``` html
<form action = "/" method = "POST">
  <input type="text" name="first_name_input" value="<%= first_name_input %>">
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>

<p>Your name is:<p>
<strong><%= name %></strong>
```

Check in the browser if you can see an input field and a button.
Once we did that we want to let our app receive the data from the text input.

Discuss the following code block:
``` ruby
post '/' do
  name = params[:first_name_input]

  erb :index, :locals => { :first_name_input => params[:first_name_input],
                           :name => name }
end
```

This is how we define what happens when somebody sends us data through the form with a POST request.
With `params[]` we get the name from our form and save it in a variable called `name`.

## Step 4: Adding more logic to the backend

Now that we receive the first name though an input field we can add more logic to our name generator.
In our app we want to create a funny new name for a person.

Read the following code line by line and discuss what it would do. Your coach will help you explain what it does.

``` ruby
def pick_name(name)
  name_hash = { 'a' => 'Amazing',
                'b' => 'Best',
                'c' => 'Cute',
                'm' => 'Magnificent'}

  first_letter = name[0].downcase

  if name_hash.has_key?(first_letter)
    name_hash[first_letter] + " " + choose_random_name
  else
    "Super #{name.capitalize}"
  end
end
```
Input these code lines below your `choose_random_name` method. After that we also need to call our method.
We do that in our POST request block: replace `:name => name` with `:name => pick_name(name)`

Extra task: You can adjust the `name_hash` to include all the letters you want to cover.

## Step 5: Making our app look cool

Now we want to give our app a cool look! Therefore, we create a new special file where we will input our styling.
Create a new folder `css` and a new file in it called `stylesheet.css`.

Now we need to tell our frontend file to use this style sheet. Input between the `<head>` tags the following lines:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/stylesheet.css">
```

In our `stylesheet.css` input some style like these:
``` css
body {
  background-color: #ffe066;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: Helvetica;
}

input[type=text] {
    width: 200px;
    padding: 12px 20px;
    margin: 8px 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    border: 2px solid black;
    border-radius: 4px;
    font-size: 15px;
}

.nice-button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.new-name {
  font-size: 3em;
}

```

There are many things you can do with CSS! Style the app like you wish. Try out other colors or font sizes.
